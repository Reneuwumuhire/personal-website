            <h1>About me ;)</h1>
            <p>Iâ€˜m seeking out opportunities to collaborate with companies / agencies /
            individuals, not just work for them. I want to bring my collective design
            experience to the table where we can work together to solve real business-
            problems in a way that optimizes all of our respective experience and
knowledge.</p>
            <p>I want to avoid subjective pissing-matches, and favor open-minded
            collaborators where egos are out of the equation. If that all sounds about right,
then lets for sure chat about how we can work together.</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out through any platforms bellow</p>
